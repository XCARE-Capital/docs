# Products & DeFi

XCARE's modular account system allows you to plug directly into leading DeFi lending protocols - without giving up custody of your assets.

You decide where your capital goes, and XCARE automates execution while keeping you in control.

Below are the currently supported lending products and the assets you can supply.

### Spark

Type: Stablecoin Lending and Borrowing

Supported Assets:

* USDC

Spark is designed for low-risk stablecoin lending, enabling consistent yields on USDC with transparent on-chain activity.

### Maple

Type: Stablecoin Lending and Borrowing

Supported Assets:

* USDC
* USDT

Maple facilitates institutional-grade lending, connecting liquidity providers to vetted borrowers, while keeping your wallet's self-custody intact.

### Aave

Type: Multi-asset Lending and Borrowing

Supported Assets:

* USDC
* USDT
* WETH
* WBTC

Aave is a well-established liquidity protocol offering a wide range of assets.

Through XCARE's module, you can supply stablecoins or crypto blue-chips like WETH and WBTC directly from your wallet.

### Morpho

Type: Optimised Lending and Borrowing

Supported Assets:

* WETH
* USDC

Morpho enhances lending efficiency by matching lenders and borrowers peer-to-peer, often improving interest rates compared to base protocols.

XCARE integrates Morpho for users looking to optimise their lending positions.

## How It Works

1. Select a Protocol - Choose Spark, Maple, Aave, or Morpho from the XCARE dashboard.
2. Choose an Asset - Pick from the supported stablecoins or blue-chip tokens.
3. Execute via Module - The account’s lending module interacts with the protocol on your behalf, using only the permissions you’ve approved.
4. Track & Withdraw Anytime - Monitor yields and withdraw your assets back to your wallet at will.

## Why Lend via XCARE?

* Self-custodial: Your assets stay in your wallet; modules only have execution rights you approve.
* Composability: Swap between protocols or assets without leaving the XCARE environment.
* Transparency: All actions are executed and recorded on-chain.
