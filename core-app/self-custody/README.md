# Self-Custody

Self-custody is at the heart of XCARE.

It means you are the only one who can access, control, and authorise movements of your assets - not XCARE, not any third party.

With XCARE approach, you get all the benefits of self-custody without the usual headaches of managing seed phrases or private keys. Our modular smart account system ensures that:

* Your funds are always under your control
* Every action is transparent and on-chain
* Security features like guardians and recovery are built in

This page explains what self-custody means, how XCARE achieves it, and why itâ€™s the foundation of everything we build.
