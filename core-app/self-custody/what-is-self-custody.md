# What is Self-Custody?

In simple terms, self-custodial means you - and only you - control your assets.

No one at XCARE can move, withdraw, or freeze your funds. The control stays entirely in your hands.

In traditional crypto wallets, self-custody is achieved by holding your private keys or seed phrases.

XCARE makes it easier - you still get the same level of control, but without the hassle of remembering long seed phrases or managing complex private keys.

We call this Web2.5 - the convenience of Web2, with the security of Web3.
