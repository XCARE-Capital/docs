# What is XCARE?

XCARE is a self-custodial automation layer for digital asset strategies - built for the next generation of crypto users and the unbanked.

It enables users to earn, swap, lend, or borrow while keeping full control of their funds - _without the need to remember seed phrases or manage complex private keys._

Combining the usability of Web2 with the sovereignty and transparency of Web3.

## **Why** XCARE **Exists**

Managing digital assets today is either:

* **Too manual** (tracking prices, moving funds, watching for gas fees), or
* **Too centralised** (giving up custody to platforms that can freeze, mismanage, or lose your assets)

XCARE changes that. We help users:

* Automate lending and other DeFi protocols
* Retain custody through smart wallets you own through EIP-4337 and EIP-7702
* Skip the stress of key management
* Authenticate with familiar Web2 methods (like email and password)
* Execute faster than manual transactions

## **The Best of Both Worlds**

With XCARE, there’s:

* **No need to store a seed phrase**
* **No risk of losing access because of a lost private key**
* **No custodial risk from centralised platforms**

Instead, XCARE offers:

* Email + password onboarding
* Account recovery and secure session management
* Optional wallet abstraction: wallets you control, automated by bots you approve

This means:

> You stay non-custodial and on-chain — without the complexity that normally comes with it.

## **What You Can Do with** XCAR&#x45;**?**

* Set up a self-custodial wallet in minutes
* Fund your wallet with SOL, USDC, or supported tokens
* Choose a strategy (e.g., DeFi, lending, automated swaps)
* Define triggers (e.g., price thresholds, time intervals)
* Track performance and withdraw anytime

All actions are transparent, traceable, and secure.

## **Who Should Use** XCAR&#x45;**?**

* Web3 users who want yield — without the tech stress
* DAOs looking for safe, rule-based capital deployment
* Trading teams automating strategies without reinventing infra
* Builders looking to integrate automation into their products

## **Built for the Future of Finance**

XCARE is more than a tool — it’s a step toward the next version of the internet:

* Web2.5 onboarding
* Web3 infrastructure
* Institutional-grade security
* Composability and transparency

Whether you’re just starting in crypto or running a complex treasury, XCARE gives you control, automation, and peace of mind - all in one place.
