# Supported Chains

XCARE is designed to be **chain-agnostic, fast, and flexible**, supporting a growing number of ecosystems that matter most to modern crypto users.

## **Currently Supported**

*   **Ethereum Mainnet**

    XCARE currently operates on Ethereum, providing full support for smart wallet creation, strategy automation, and fee-managed interactions with DeFi protocols. Users can execute on-chain instructions with the assurance of full custody and transparency.

## **Coming Soon**

*   **Solana**

    Weâ€™re bringing our signature self-custodial automation to Solana - enabling high-speed, low-fee execution of strategies like arbitrage, swaps (via Jupiter, Orca, Raydium), and wallet management.
*   **Starknet**

    XCARE is also extending to the ZK-rollup world with Starknet, giving users scalability, privacy, and low-cost automation on a truly next-gen L2.
* **Bitcoin**\
  Our expansion to Bitcoin will bring XCARE non-custodial wallet system to the original blockchain.

## **Why Multi-chain?**

Our mission is to make automated, self-custodial finance accessible everywhere - regardless of which network you call home.

Whether you operate on Ethereum today or Solana tomorrow, XCARE ensures your funds stay **secure**, **non-custodial**, and **automated**.

Stay tuned for updates, and check our roadmap for integration timelines.
